    <string name="theBeeMovie">According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly.
Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground.
The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees dont care what humans think is impossible.
Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
Ooh, black and yellow!
Lets shake it up a little.
Barry! Breakfast is ready!
Coming!
Hang on a second.

Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house!
Hey, Adam.
Hey, Barry.
Is that fuzz gel?
A little. Special day, graduation.
Never thought Id make it.
Three days grade school, three days high school.
Those were awkward.
Three days college. Im glad I took a day and hitchhiked around The Hive.
You did come back different.
Hi, Barry. Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.
Hear about Frankie?
Yeah.
You going to the funeral?
No, Im not going.
Everybody knows, sting someone, you die.
Dont waste it on a squirrel.
Such a hothead.
I guess he could have just gotten out of the way.
I love this incorporating an amusement park into our day.
Thats why we dont need vacations.
Boy, quite a bit of pomp under the circumstances.
Well, Adam, today we are men.
We are!
Bee-men.
Amen!
Hallelujah!
Students, faculty, distinguished bees,
please welcome Dean Buzzwell.
Welcome, New Hive City graduating class of 9:15.
That concludes our ceremonies And begins your career at Honex Industries!
Will we pick our job today?
I heard its just orientation.
Heads up! Here we go.
Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times.
Wonder what itll be like?
A little scary.
Welcome to Honex, a division of Honesco and a part of the Hexagon Group.
This is it!
Wow.
Wow.
We know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life to get to the point where you can work for your whole life.
Honey begins when our valiant Pollen Jocks bring the nectar to The Hive.
Our top-secret formula is automatically color-corrected, scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured into this soothing sweet syrup with its distinctive golden glow you know asâ€¦ Honey!
That girl was hot.
Shes my cousin!
She is?
Yes, were all cousins.
Right. Youre right.
At Honex, we constantly strive to improve every aspect of bee existence.
These bees are stress-testing a new helmet technology.
What do you think he makes?
Not enough.
Here we have our latest advancement, the Krelman.
What does that do?
Catches that little strand of honey that hangs after you pour it.
Saves us millions.
Can anyone work on the Krelman?
Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones.
But bees know that every small job, if its done well, means a lot.
But choose carefully because youll stay in the job you pick for the rest of your life.
The same job the rest of your life? I didnt know that.
Whats the difference?
Youll be happy to know that bees, as a species, havent had one day off in 27 million years.
So youll just work us to death?
Well sure try.
Wow! That blew my mind!
"Whats the difference?"
How can you say that?
One job forever?
